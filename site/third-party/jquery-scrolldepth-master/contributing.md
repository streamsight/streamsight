# Contributing to Scroll Depth

Contributions are welcome! There are just a few requested guidelines:

* Please create a feature branch for your changes and squash commits
* Don't worry about updating the version, changelog, or minified version (I can take care of that)
* Please respect the original syntax/formatting stuff
* If proposing a new feature, it may be a good idea to create an issue first to discuss

Thanks!
